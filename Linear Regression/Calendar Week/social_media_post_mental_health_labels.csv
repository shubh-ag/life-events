I knew one day he would go home to be with the Lord, but I didn’t think that day would come so soon. Words can’t express how much I miss him. Uncle Armel was more than an Uncle to me, he was also my godfather, a role he took seriously. Uncle Armel was the embodiment of my Heavenly Father on earth. He showed me the same unconditional love. He taught me the importance of keeping God first place, maintaining a relationship with The Lord, and serving God always. . I miss Uncle Armel’s morning prayers, I miss his smile, and I miss his hearing his voice. . As my wedding approaches, part of me is sad because I won’t get to see him with my physical eyes, but another part of me  knows that he will be there in spirit smiling a smile that only he could smile.",2.7142857142857144,Medium,6.666666666666667,Medium,2.2857142857142856,Medium
