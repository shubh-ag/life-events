We saw the same homeless man that we saw over the summer at an intersection in Illinois. He clearly has medical troubles with his legs but I'm sure can't afford to seek medical attention.  Not only did my mom give him money over the summer but she gave $20 more on Friday. He was so thankful and looked like he was tearing up after she handed it to him...which in turn made us all get teary eyed too.   I'm so proud to be her daughter and I forever will try to be a good person like she is. ‚ù§,,,,,,,

With a comprehensive curriculum that applies the power of running, the program encourages boys to develop their psychological, emotional and social health, in addition to their physical health. . Twice a week for seven weeks, two trained volunteer coaches lead an elementary or middle school team through practice. Designed to amplify confidence, self-expression, and respect for others, each practice includes a lesson from the Let Me Run curriculum that incorporates running, games and activities.

Most of all though to my beautiful wife Courtney Forster. You are so amazing and I can't imagine how much life would suck without you to share it with. You are an amazing mother that has taught our boys how to be good, polite and respectful. That is quite rare today I think. Most importantly though you are teaching them how to be godly gentlemen. That's one of the things I love most about you. I am incomplete without you. I am cold hearted. I am angry. I am a lesser man. That's why Jesus gave me you is so I could live a happier more fulfilling life. You bring me closer to Jesus. I love you more than anything else on this earth and I always will.

It sounds like manufacturers can no longer have channels on YouTube, as they are generally intending to sell guns. If someone makes an instructional safety video but also links to the manufacturer's webpage, it also seems like it would be banned. They're more than welcome to do whatever they want on their platform, it just seems a little over-reaching. Policy: https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/7667605?hl=en",,,,,,,

So Seattle is going to attempt to tax its way out of homelessness?  Obviously I do not live there and if they are going to be taxing 20mil + businesses. The larger impact is the tax per employee is going to impact the rest of the country as it will be penalized for this tax.  When Amazon and Starbucks and other national companies start building the tax into their products.. No government can tax themselves out of problems in my opinion.  I wonder what the impact will be 10+ years from now?  Less homelessness? Same level? Increased homelessness?  What if businesses start relocating out of Seattle due to this tax?. Anyway, let me know what you think..",,,,,,,

Today''s weather was similar to 2001. It made me remember seeing lots of students standing outside the dorms on their  cellphones where the reception was much better. With so many students from both coasts you knew that people were checking on family and loved ones. Others spontaneously gathered at the grotto. Later in the afternoon Mass was held on the South Quad for the whole campus. I remember helping my beloved boss and friend Dave Prentkowski hauling cases of bottled water for those that needed it as the day had warmed up quite a bit. And then we sat silently and listened to the priests and contemplated the sad events of that horrible day.,,,,,,,

I have always felt it had a little bit of everything. Rocking Helter Skelter and Back in the USSR, the plaintive almost haunting Dear Prudence, the sonic soaring musicianship on While My Guitar Gently Weeps, Lennon‚Äôs painful ode to his mother Julia, a peek through Alice‚Äôs Looking Glass Onion in Cry Baby Cry, McCartney‚Äôs elegant social commentary of Blackbird.

A 2016 independent study conducted by University of North Carolina at Greensboro√¢¬Ä¬ôs Institute to Promote Athlete Health and Wellness finds Let Me Run is making a substantial positive impact in boys√¢¬Ä¬ô lives. A review of the professional literature revealed UNCG√¢¬Ä¬ôs groundbreaking study to be the first published to examine healthy masculinity in boys, as well as a program√¢¬Ä¬ôs ability to improve it.. Let Me Run seeks to break down negative societal pressures that require males to mask their authentic selves behind a performance of masculinity, in which the most praised emotions are anger, aggression and pride. Phrases like √¢¬Ä¬úman up,√¢¬Ä¬ù √¢¬Ä¬úboys don√¢¬Ä¬ôt cry√¢¬Ä¬ù and √¢¬Ä¬ústop being a girl√¢¬Ä¬ù serve as catalysts for this type of destructive macho-masculinity. As described by Dr. William Pollack in his book Real Boys, these unhealthy male stereotypes, which Pollack refers to as the √¢¬Ä¬úBoy Code,√¢¬Ä¬ù can stand in the way of boys√¢¬Ä¬ô positive futures and lead to disturbing consequences such as illness, decreased learning potential, addiction, and violence. These often unspoken issues lead ninety men in the U.S. to commit suicide every day, four of whom are boys under the age of 19.",,,,,,,

Encourage all your love ones to get one. I am so thankful that I had one done on November 5th, because I knew it was a year since my last one.  Long story short they discovered a small mass on my left breast.  It was so small I could not feel it.  The needle biopsy confirmed that it is a slow growing cancer. On January 17th the mass will be removed. If the pathology report comes back the way we hope it means on radiation twice a day for 5 days. After the radiation I will be taking a pill once a day.  Do to this little bump in the road my knee replacement surgery that was supposed to be done on November 27th will not happen for a few months.  I am so thankful for all of the love, prayers and support from my family and friends.  Please make sure  you get a mammogram and remember men can also get breast cancer. Have a wonderful holiday season and may 2019 bring you happiness, love, peace and good health.  Love all of you.",HealthLoss,,,HealthLoss,,,

This morning, Cindy and I got up and cleaned out my 2003 Malibu to take it to a local dealership because I wanted a new car.. As we got close, we were sitting at a stop-light.  Suddenly WHAM!!! I was rear-ended.. Sigh......figures..going to trade in the ride and I get hit.  Cindy jumps out before I did and she''s already around to my side telling me I have no damage.  Guy is back there, I get out and we look - neither of us has any damage.  Really wasn''t anyone''s fault.  Roads were icy and he said he couldn''t get the car to stop despite the fact that he tried way back to stop - I get it - been there and got lucky that I didn''t bump anyone.. I look at the guy and he''s wearing a jacket of the dealership we were going to!  I ask if he works there (his name is also on the jacket so I''m guessing yes).  He does!  . I laughed and said we were just on our way there.. What kind of car are we going to look at?  I said either a Hyundai or Subaru - that''s where he works!!  So I told him we were going to get a Starbucks and we''d be over - I even offered to buy him a coffee (which he declined) - then we informed him he was going to be our salesman.. By the time we got there, everyone in the dealership was talking about how he rear-ended my car and ended up getting a customer.. Yeah I got a car - nice deal and everyone there was exceptionally nice.. *We''re both a little sore from the jolt but nothing bad.",NonInjuryAccident,,,InstallmentPurchase,,,

There are tons of kids, mostly all living in motels with either their families, friends or foster families. These kids are applicable for every food assistance program available to them. Free lunches and all that jazz. Long story short, some friends of mine decided to start cooking hot meals and bringing them to these families. Nice, hot, home cooked meals. They had a picnic in the parking lot. It was beautiful, so they started to make it a regular thing.. Well, low and behold, the city finds out and wants to slap a $3000 fine for eating a meal with these families. They say there needs to be a commercial kitchen, blah blah blah. They wanna shut this shit down. ... *makes that one face* . I want ya√¢¬Ä¬ôll to shift your perspective for a second, because this is an incident of a widespread cultural shortcoming. When was the last time a commercial kitchen was required to feed your family and friends for a get-together? Fucking answer me that. When was the last time you grilled some burgers with your neighbor, and he was like, √¢¬Ä¬úShow me your permit.√¢¬Ä¬ù Is it illegal to feed each other at a block party? Nope. Is it illegal to bbq at a tailgate with your friends? Nope. Then it shouldn√¢¬Ä¬ôt be illegal to do what we do. What√¢¬Ä¬ôs the difference? That they√¢¬Ä¬ôre poor and hungry?√¢¬Ä¬ù",,,,,,,

Overnight, after airing the story, the city of Belton reached out and is now saying that they won√¢¬Ä¬ôt fine anyone.  The process worked, but it shouldn√¢¬Ä¬ôt ever be an issue to consider.

Also note this is Florida who just fucking elected Voldemort for another six years to the senate after spending 8 years destroying the state as governor ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è . ‚ÄúUsually I discuss or think about an issue before commenting. Instead, today, I am going to give you whatever my initial knee-jerk thoughts are. Here goes:.  . This is stupid. It''s a shotgun approach (see how many companies and, by extension, steps in the process are being targeted with this lawsuit). I have no love for any company that puts profit above patient care but this has been a tricky issue. . Did the pharmacies become aware something was wrong? Sure. But when? . Did they have the means to stop it? Possibly. But what steps could they have taken? Limit doses distributed to each pharmacy? . We didn''t have a PMP database in many states until quite recently. A National database? Nope. . Here is the biggest problem I have with the State of Florida. When patients are showing up in another state, approximately 2000-3000 miles away with prescriptions from pain clinics from your state (Georgia was just as guilty), how can you not recognise the problem resides in your state? It''s not the fault of the pharmacies for filling the prescriptions, at least not initially. . (Especially troubling is when your regular patients begin to see those prescribers. Are they turning into bad patients? or are they simply caught in the mix as the prescriber turns to the Dark Side? This requires vigilance on the part of the pharmacists but we know before anyone else who and where the bad prescribers are. And we report them.). The guiltiest party is the State of Florida itself. The most surprising part was the speed with which pain clinics were allowed to set up and flourish in the State of Florida. Pharmacists reported them and what did the state do? Nothing. It takes years to investigate and shut down a clinic such as these. (Which is mind-boggling in itself.) Licenses of the prescribers? Slaps on the wrists; many still allowed to practise. . . or they relocated. . Maybe this is just a distraction technique. Maybe, if the state goes after someone or, as in this case, everyone, the people will forget and ignore that the state is just as culpable in their citizens'' deaths as the prescribers who were allowed to set up shop and prescribe freely. . (Can I write another post showing how the pharmacies should/could share responsibility? Sure. But like I said, this is my initial reaction and I''m not writing a thesis today.) As I have long said, it''s really easy to point the finger at the end of the line because the further up the process you go, the more likely you''ll find yourself to blame. (Remember my Water Treatment Plant analogy? Yeah. This is so that.). New Headline: CVS, Walgreens sued by Florida after State allowed pain clinics to set up shop and kill its residents. #FixedIt‚Äù",,,,,,,

But the immigrants themselves rarely have the necessary cash. Immigration bonds are never less than $1,500 and are usually closer to $5,000, $10,000, or more. The bonds will, eventually, get repaid, once the immigrant‚Äôs case is heard. A bond is not a fine: It‚Äôs just a surety, designed to ensure that the immigrant shows up to all court dates. Once the immigrant has obtained legal status or has been deported, a process that can take well over a year, then the conditions of the bond are met, and the government gives the money back. A permanent bond fund, which has the resources to bail out every detained parent, and ideally every wrongfully detained immigrant, is a fantastic public good, and once it‚Äôs seeded with enough money, it can operate almost indefinitely..",,,,,,,

And I''m glad I did, not because Tolstoy offers a view of history that is hopeful or optimistic.  Nope. Tolstoy makes it very clear that he believes people will continue to harm each other for reasons that are beyond our understanding for the rest of time. Bad stuff happens and we have relatively little control over our lives.  . But he''s an artist, not a historian -- he reminds the reader of that fact repeatedly -- and he also urges the reader not to put their faith in so-called great men. They ain''t nothin.  Instead make the truth your hero.  And use love -- love for life, love for everyone -- as your guiding force.  . Tolstoy and I disagree on some things (i.e., women, just about anything he says about women), but he was a person who thought deeply and seriously about big things and it was a pleasure to spend to day with him.  . Up next for me: TBD palate-cleansing genre fiction and then Women, Race, and Class by Angela Y. Davis",,,,,,,

I went to New York two weeks after 9/11 to visit a friend in Williamsburg, Brooklyn. I took the bus. Port Authority was as you‚Äôd imagine. Walls plastered with posters pleading for info about missing loved ones, the smiling faces at the center of each piece of cheap photocopy paper in stark contrast to the desperate message and the knowledge that they were all dead. Clusters of lit candles along the wall made the grimy bus terminal feel like a holy site.. I took the subway to Brooklyn. My friend and her roommates, all artists living in a warehouse illegally converted into apartments, talked about the way the air smelled. It smelled like smoke. It smelled like fuel. She opened a kitchen drawer and took out a stack of what looked like scrap paper. Every sheet had scorch marks. Some were just a little singed on the edge. Others had gaping holes. She thrust them at me. They floated across the river, she explained. The air smelled, she said, like burning paper. All those offices. Her eyes were wet. . We went to brunch. We talked about books. I was reading Turgenev‚Äôs Virgin Soil. She was reading Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire. A roommate was reading Gaddis. The conversation returned to 9/11. What would happen. Probably a War. I worried about people I knew who were in the military. Surely the war would be short. No, said the Gaddis reader, not short. Not contained. .

The reporter also failed to mention that there are duties particular to the principal oboe position. . It would have been helpful to compare rates of all non-section orchestral positions in the top 10 (or even top 5) orchestras across America and then note who holds those positions.  . I think that would have been enlightening.. It will be interesting to see what happens.,,,,,,,

I was worried that the  red wine vinegar are lemon juice would be over powering for the buyer. It was not. Just enough bitter from to notice it but not to cause issues. The tomato did not add anything to the burger for me. The spinach was good. I would leave the spinach mixed with the burger but the spinach to top it would sub for raw instead of having both cooked. It would have added a nice cool crunch to the burger. I did not use enough salt and pepper while seasoning the beef. I used a good quality mozzarella and that made me happy. . I would definitely eat this one again.,,,,,,,

The short version is it was a joy. Their website doesn''t do a great job of explaining it, but hopefully this image does. It has two robust multimode filter sections, but then an additional third spaced filter (LP/HP, BP/BP, etc) that you can feed the signal through for texture and harmonics. So think 2 main signal paths but then an additional one for movement or dynamics (e.g., super resonant velocity plucks on top of your main bass).. http://www.schmidt-synthesizer.com/images/gallery/schmidt_detail_07.jpg",,,,,,,

We looked at Gliffy, Draw.io, Lucidchart, Sketchboard, and Cacoo. The winner was Lucidchart because it's the only one that nails multi-user collaboration. Draw.io is free, but a few things bugged us, especially the pseudo-google UI and ACLs that don't work very well. It looks exactly like a google product but doesn't work like one, and that confuses a distributed team who works on google docs + sheets with familiar functions all day. It seems like it's just in a holding pattern hoping for an Atlassian acquisition someday. Sketchboard is weird and too specialized to charge what they are charging for it. Gliffy and Lucidchart are nearly neck in neck featurewise and pricewise, but Lucidchart was just easier, has more templates, better collaboration, etc., so we went with that. In the end we needed a tool that our support team &  receptionists felt comfortable using instead of just the engineers, so usability and friendliness wins.",,,,,,,

I will never forget the way I felt that morning, waking to the news that something so horrendous had happened. I remember saying, now there''s nowhere we are safe, and at the time I truly believed it. I was lost in many ways then, and it was easier to lose hope than to rise up and refuse to be terrorized. Today, I''m a much different, stronger person and I am so proud of all of my LGBTQ family for continuing to be out and proud. We are not afraid, we are not ashamed, we do not hate. We embrace everyone with open arms and work day in and day out to make the world better for the future. We have a long way to go, but we have come so far. .

The idea is to see who reads a post without a picture. If no one reads my post, this will be a very short experiment. But if you are reading this message, make a comment using a single word about how we met. After that, copy this message on your wall and I will also leave you a word.

I happened to be wearing a Red Sox cap that day.  He introduced himself and mentioned that he grew up in Gardner, MA.  So when you see his commercials about growing up in a 'factory town'"", that''s what he''s referencing.  The Red Sox bond is strong, so even though he''s a Democrat I could see myself voting for him depending on who the Republican nominee is (gasp!).  2) Last year at the NYC Marathon, at the tent for disabled runners, a man approached me.  He noticed my Achilles Nashville shirt.  He said, '""Hi, I''m Randy Boyd, I''m running for Tennessee governor.'""  He was there because he was guiding a disabled runner.  He has run hundreds of miles throughout Tennessee to raise money for charity.  I think it says a lot about his character that he has never mentioned any of this in his ads (as a Republican).  On that basis I am strongly inclined to support him.  Just my two cents.  Joe, I am sure you will rake me over the coals, do your worst!""",,,,,,,

When the evidence was presented, there was no doubt in John‚Äôs mind that Jesus was who He said He was, the Messiah, the Son of God.. After reviewing the evidence, who do YOU say Jesus is? One day you will have to answer this question before the judgement seat of God. Now is the time to contemplate this question. Glad to give you my perspective if you wish. Just reach out.. Let me leave you with this. Jesus was one of three things; Lord, liar or lunatic.. If he was a liar, he knew he was not the Messiah and misled millions to their eternal separation of God.. If he was a lunatic, he really believed that he was the Son of God, but did not have authority and led millions to their spiritual death. Definitely not a good man, prophet or teacher (how he is referred to by people who do not recognize Him as Lord).. Or Lord. When I examine the evidence, I am 100% convinced that Jesus is what he claimed to be; the Son of God and the Savior of the world.",,,,,,,

John is preaching reprentance and setting the stage for Jesus. May come to him asking what should they do:. * if you have 2 tunics, share with one who has none. * if you have food, do the likewise. * Tax collectors - collect no more than what is due. * Soldiers - do not extort money using false threats and accusations. Be content with your wages. So basically, we are to share, care for the poor and do what is honorable and right in our dealings with others. The chapter ends with the genealogy of Jesus, starting with him and going backwards. This is important as it demonstrates fulfillment of prophecy that Jesus was to come from the line of David. It also demonstrates to me that family matters. Understand your family tree and where you come from and the impact that has on your life. Someday, you will just be a name in the middle of your tree.

Key takeaway; since we were created for worship, take on the characteristics of what we worship.. The psalmist shares a song of praise with the affirmation that God Himself made us, and we are His. Believers are encouraged to walk in fellowship with God in order to have the fullness of joy in their lives. Those who follow and obey Him will experience His goodness, His everlasting mercy, and His enduring truth. Because we belong to God, our worship should be reserved for Him. Since we were created for worship, we will inevitably worship. Whatever it is that we choose to worship we will take on its characteristics.  If we worship self‚Ä¶ we become selfish, self-righteous, and self-focused.  If we worship money, a career, promotion, or position‚Ä¶ we become envious, competitive, discontented. If we worship a person or a relationship‚Ä¶ we become insecure and approval-seeking. However, when we worship and fellowship with God, we become like Him. We take on His fruit and His Spirit displaying His love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, and self-control.",,,,,,,

Father God, You are the Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the ending, the author and finisher of our faith. We were created to worship You. Though sometimes, Lord, my heart strays and I struggle to seek You first. So many other things and so many people have my heart, steal Your worship, and distract me from Your love. Lord, empty me of the preoccupation with materialism, worry, and anxiety. Remove any idols in my life that seek to take Your place in my heart.  Lord, forgive my selfishness, my self-centeredness, and my self-seeking ways. When I struggle to trust You with my needs, remind me that You are bigger than my desires, my worries and fears, and my small plans and ambitions.

Scripture is very clear on this as none of us have or is capable of living a perfect live. Romans 3:23 ‚ÄúFor all have sinned and fall short of the Glory of God.‚Äù Scripture also gives us guidance on how we can observe and evaluate the heart and intentions of people around us. In Matthew 7:15-20, Jesus tells us we can know people by the fruit they bear. While specifically related to identifying false prophets, this guidance is also relevant to observing those around us as well. Verse 18 states ‚ÄúA healthy tree cannot bear bad fruit, nor can a diseased tree bear good fruit.‚Äù When observing or assessing anyone in authority, teachers, politicians, clergy, etc.  look for consistency of behavior indicating either a healthy or diseased ‚Äútree=life‚Äù. Remember, there was and will ever be ONE perfect person and he willingly gave HIS life for our imperfections so we can be reconciled with God. You too can receive the cleansing of His blood and forgiveness of your sins regardless of how bad off a life you think you have led. No sin is too great for forgiveness. The next verse after Romans 3:23 tells us all we need to know ‚Äúand are justified by his grace as a gift, through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus.‚Äù Thank you Jesus for dying for my sins.",,,,,,,

You get a call from your bank saying there has been fraud on your account (Caller ID said USAA so they spoof their phone number). Everything looks legit, you get confirmation codes via text. Turns out, you are talking to a fraudster who has someone else with them who are spoofing YOU to your bank. So all of the validation emails, etc are legitimate, but they are coming due to actions the fraudster is trying to accomplish with your bank (move funds, initiate wire transfers etc). Learned this first hand today. Fortunately, I got suspicious and called the bank directly. They could see the outbound text messages, but the operator sending them was Elizabeth and I was talking to a DUDE. FRUSTRATED. USAA was able to stop all the transactions so no loss, other than time and account resets, etc. Valuable lesson. So - if your bank calls you unexpectedly, tell them you will call them back (USAA confirmed this is a best practice and not offensive). Ask for a name and extension. Make sure you are using a trusted phone number for your bank.""",,,,,,,

What issues are you passionate about?. Yes on Amendment 73 establishes tax brackets at 200k, 300k, and 500k, raise the corp rate (4.63% to 6%) for state income taxes and lower the property tax rates (residential: 7.2% to 7% and non-residential: 29% to 24%). The measure would also establish the Quality Public Education Fund to help fund K-12 schooling, a commonly overlooked area that is deserving of more public funding. . Yes on Amendment Y and Z, measures that would create an independent board (made up of an even representation of Dems, Reps, and unaffiliated totaling 12 members) in charge of drafting state legislative and U.S. federal congressional district lines.  Death to the 2 party system! . (Sorry 5ish) Yes on Proposition 110 (No on Prop 109), measure to authorize $6 billion in new government bonds to help fund transportation infrastructure improvements. In order to pay back the bonds, it would raise the state sales tax for 20 years to 3.52%. The critical piece here where it differs from Prod 109, is that this one authorizes the increase of sales tax, so that visitors and temporary residents can help fund our state and local roads. Prop 109 funds will only authorize bonds that will only impact state roads (leaving 88% of roads ineligible for funding). . Feel free to ask me more about my choices if you don''t know how to vote tomorrow. https://powactionfund.org/take-action/colorado/ is a great source of info regarding both sides of each measure and state/federal candidate. And please correct me if you see anything wrong in my reasoning, I have sources to back all these decisions from POW!. .",,,,,,,

On my drive to work this morning I realized something drastic. How many of you at one time or another have felt like someone else was deciding who you are for you? The answer is everyone. We live in a world full of opinions. That being said, truly, the only person who can decide who you are and what you stand for, your good qualities, your bad qualities, the things you want to work on, the really great parts of you that make you YOU is...infact, YOU. I, probably am the most guilty of letting other peoples opinions of me become my truth. It''s a curse, seriously! Someone doesn''t agree with the way I operate, finds my humor offensive, decides I''m not worthy of their friendship, reminds me of my demons in the past --and these are just to name a few. Do you know what I''ve always done? I''ve held onto those words, the hate, the disagreements, the OPINIONS of others and I sort of tell myself that this is who I am, I punish me for being human instead of reminding myself that this life is so much more than someone elses opinion of me. What I''m trying to convey with this is----don''t ever let another person in your life determine the way you feel about you. It''s fine to take advice, it''s fine to learn new ways to communicate and to be the very best version of yourself that you can but please---do THAT for you, not for the person deciding you''re unworthy or for the people who think they know you, that truly don''t even have a clue. Stay true to yourself and love HARD. Don''t be afraid to mess up. How can we be loved by others and really appreciate all of the good in this world if we''re too busy hating on ourselves and wishing we were something that we''re not. This post is mostly for me. A big FAT reminder that I''m AWESOME and that so are all of you. If you have a roof over your head, food on your plate, a place to call home, family and friends----that right there is enough to say, you''re doing something right. Life is hard and we, as people, should do our best to remind others that we are enough, we are important, we have the power.. Enjoy your Monday folks! . <3",,,,,,had an epiphany,

Now, I take my lunch break time and the morning and afternoon breaks in between to cover the time I spent away from my desk crossing my fingers and hoping there''s no cavity or broken filling that''s going to cost me an arm and a leg. This, my friends, is part of being an adult...and while I care about my health, there is no longer a reward for good hygiene. Some of the little things don''t excite my adult brain like they did when I was just a girl still make for beautiful memories my mother has given me and the fun times I got to experience growing up are something I''ll never forget and will cherish forever. . With all that being said---Being an adult means getting to make your own decisions, having the freedom that has no limit and adventuring in all of the ways that make me feel happy, being my own guide is fun and I''m enjoying the ride just as much if not more! <3",,,,,,,

I ordered wine and St Germain, and the great part of it was the St Germain, obvs. Delivery went a bit awry and the driver finally called and asked me to meet him downstairs instead of delivering to the door (delivery to your door is the norm). Met him, he passed me the bag and took off. Took three steps and just as I entered the lobby of my building the bag breaks and the St Germain and a bottle of wine fall out and shatter. Only then did I notice that the bag was wet so I got upset that it wasn‚Äôt me that screwed up but the delivery that caused me to lose $50+ of the delivery.. Left a 2-Star review and figured the experience was over, but Drizly reacted and, with the photo evidence of the shattered bottles, has sent out a replacement for both at no charge. Just got a notice that the replacements are 5 minutes out! . So, use @Drizly for your booze deliveries. I‚Äôm really impressed.",,,,,,,

Specifically....  ‚ÄúDurant is the more conventionally unstoppable player. But it‚Äôs hard to ignore the fact that KD joined a team that could have been a dynasty without him, a team that had won 73 games in large part due to Curry‚Äôs individual brilliance. While Curry can shoot any team out of a gym, the attention he commands off the ball is almost just as important. He‚Äôs always moving, he‚Äôs a willing screener, and he can launch in even the smallest bit of airspace. So many of the Warriors‚Äô comically open looks are the result of Curry‚Äôs gravity, and those stats aren‚Äôt quite as easy to measure as points per game or field-goal percentage.‚Äù.",,,,,,,

It was still fun, always enjoy cooking.. I did everything scratch, and didn''t follow a recipe. It turned out really good, I think, but it didn''t pull down the votes. I had ground beef, venison, and steak; pinto, black, and red kidney beans, heirloom, roma, and cherry tomatoes, plus chili, chipotle , and cubanelle pepper.. Some lessons learned for next year:. * Chipotle chili blows out almost all subtly. I had three proteins in my chili, each cooked separately with different layers of flavor. You can''t taste any of it, because the chipotle blows it all out. I wanted the smokey flavor in there, so next time I''ll try a different approach to getting the smoke without covering up all the other depth.. * Al dente beans stay al dente in a crock pot. I left my beans slightly under on the theory that they would cook more in the crock pot on the day of the cook-off, leaving them perfect when the tasters came. Instead, my slightly-under beans stayed slightly under. I don''t mind it at all, but it isn''t what most tasters expect in chili, and may have been off-putting.. * The toppings don''t matter. I brought fresh avocado, sour cream, fresh chopped green onions, and Frito chips as adornments to my chili. Although it''s delicious to put all that on top, most tasters didn''t bother so it should not be a factor in the flavor profile.. * Start earlier. I started my chili around 8:00pm for the next day. It was fine, but I would have benefited from more hours to allow the spices to fully bloom. I detected some notes of raw spices in my chili that wouldn''t have been there had I allowed a longer cook time on the overall dish. Plus, that cook time might have finished my beans, giving a double benefit.. Next year, that apron will be mine!",,,,,,,

As trite as it is, the counter-argument is true: people who break laws don''t care about laws. There are laws against murder, yet people commit murder.. The issue of gun violence isn''t about mental health. This is a cop-out -- mental illness is not inherently violent, and mental health treatment requires the active participation of the person being treated. Even if treatment were more readily available, which I agree it should be, if you don''t seek help it doesn''t really matter how available it is. Even if we had free mental healthcare in this country, it wouldn''t stop gun violence.. The problem is cultural. We''ve spent generations glorifying gun violence, and making heroes out of people who use guns in the name of the state. From soldiers to cops, we make games out of it, we make movies about it, we encourage our children into the professions. We idolize it, we glorify it. We embrace gun violence, in part because it''s the only way we can maintain our ethical and moral self-image as a people and live with the terrible harm our society causes to other people. We celebrate gun violence and those who perpetuate it because it''s a national trauma, and we are ultimately powerless to change it so we find ways to live with it. Our media, our entertainment, our very sense of heroism is wrapped around the good guy/bad guy dichotomy, solved with a bullet. The bullet has been with us since the creation of this country, and it''s built into our national ethos.. No law will change that. No mental health service will change that. We look for answers in every place but ourselves. If we do not accept gun violence, we must reject it at every level. Not just in a school shooting, but institutional violence, state violence, all violence. As long as we live in a society which endorses certain kinds of violence, we will always be forced to normalize and accept it, and we will always be victims of that violence because it lives in our culture. It isn''t a mental health issue. It isn''t a gun control issue. It''s a culture issue, it''s what we are willing and not willing to accept, under any justification. As long as we have the soldier and the cop, armed with a gun, justified in violence, we will see that violence reflected at every other level of our society. If we want to reject or replace that lifestyle, we have to do it at every level. Every level. That''s all of us.",,,,,,,

There is definitely more snow here than in Colorado mountains. It was around 14F and heavy snow the whole day. The whole place looks like winter wonderland.  I am amazed at the number of walking people and free walking dogs everywhere. You call it a culture shock.. I saw every member of my family and we were able to chat with my deployed husband. The evening ended up with banya and domestic wine that my uncle made. It was delicious! Great laughs and great company..

Apparantly, I dont know how to read airplane tickets and went to the wrong airport in Moscow where I would have taken the only flight to my parents house! With all the Moscow ridiculous traffic, I didn''t make it to my flight of course, but miraculously made it to the train station to catch a train home (5min before it left). The money I was planning to save originally...I definitely spent like 10 times more. Oh well. Let''s see how the rest of the trip goes. . Oh and here are the roads in Moscow. Of course, I came during the time when the heaviest snow storm hit Moscow in 68 years!!!",VacationPlanFail,,,Vacation,VacationEvents,,

Even though it wasn''t as bad as  2016 and 2017 it was still a year.  Thank you 2018 for all the good in the universe, vibes and all the life lessons learned.  The one thing I have learned is not to regret and ponder on the past and just learn from it and move on. In 2019 I want to create memories, leave the past in the past and continue the good positive vibes.  I wish for health, happiness, lots of memories, good vibes and a bit of wealth.  Not only do I wish this for me but wish this for all my family and friends.  . Happy New Year!",,,,,,,

Keep only what you need.. ‚Ä¢ It‚Äôs okay to cry when you‚Äôre hurt. It‚Äôs also okay to smash (some) things; but, wash your face, clean your mess & get up off the floor when you‚Äôre done. You don‚Äôt belong down there.. ‚Ä¢ If you‚Äôre going to cuss, be clever. If you‚Äôre going to cuss in public, think again. . ‚Ä¢ Just because you can, doesn‚Äôt mean you should.. ‚Ä¢ 5-second rule. It‚Äôs just dirt. There are worse things in a fast food cheeseburger.. ‚Ä¢ You‚Äôre a woman - you don‚Äôt NEED a man/woman- but it‚Äôs ok to want the right one. . ‚Ä¢ Happiness is not a permanent state; it takes intentional effort everyday. . ‚Ä¢ Pain is inevitable, but suffering is a choice. . ‚Ä¢ Never, ever walk through an alley alone!. ‚Ä¢ Be less sugar, more spice, and only as nice as you‚Äôre able to without compromising yourself.. ‚Ä¢ CAN‚ÄôT is a cop-out! Do set your goals high. . ‚Ä¢ If you can‚Äôt smile with your eyes, don‚Äôt smile. Insincerity is nothing to aspire to.. ‚Ä¢ Never lie to yourself.. ‚Ä¢ Your body, your rules.. ‚Ä¢ Ask for what you want. The worst thing they can say is no. . ‚Ä¢ Wish on stars and dandelions, then get to WORK to make them happen.. ‚Ä¢ Stay as sweet as you are.. ‚Ä¢ Fall in love with the universe, music, memories, literature, food & travel.. ‚Ä¢ Take lots of pictures along the way.. ‚Ä¢ Say Please, Thank You & I‚Äôm. Sorry whenever the situation warrants it.. ‚Ä¢ Naps are for grown-ups, too.. ‚Ä¢ Question everything, except your own INTUITION. . ‚Ä¢ You have enough, you are enough.. ‚Ä¢ You‚Äôre AMAZING! Don''t let anyone ever make you feel you‚Äôre not. If someone does... walk away. You deserve better. Never forget that!. ‚Ä¢ No matter where you are, you can always come home... ALWAYS!!. ‚Ä¢ Say what you mean and mean what you say. . ‚Ä¢ No one will ever LOVE YOU more than I do.. ‚Ä¢ Be kind; treat others how you would like them to treat you.. ‚Ä¢ If in doubt, remember whose DAUGHTER you are and straighten your crown üëë..

Equality is not about everyone getting the same thing it is about being fairly treated. For example a punishment for one of my children might not have the same affect as it would on another child. I punish the kids differently based on the need to get to the desired outcome. Just like in punishment I also reward them differently based on what each one desires. I reward them differently because I know what they need to feel loved. . I believe when people say they want equality I believe they really want to be loved and everyone has a different love language. Don''t be confused and chase after someone else''s love language because you are not receiving from your love language.,,,,,,,

Although we only had the privilege of being your humans for the last three months, you brought a lot of joy and amusement to our lives. You always handled things on your terms, and we appreciated your strong, independent nature. You quickly settled into our pack, but you weren''t shy about letting the other dogs know if they were acting like fools.. We got a lot of laughs when you would deliberately take your treats and plop in front of the other dogs to savor them. If something (or someone) was in your way, you didn''t hesitate to pound on through to your destination. Until last week, we would get tired before you would when playing ball. Although your hearing and vision weren''t at full strength, that didn''t keep you from diving in the boxwood bushes to investigate rabbits and other suspicious interlopers. . We send many thanks to Kalamazoo Animal Rescue, Pita''s foster mom, Rebecca, and Rebecca''s family for taking such great care of Pita while under your care. Although we will always miss her, we are thankful that we got to be a part of her journey.. Rest easy, Pita.",PetDied,,,PetDied,PetDeath,,

Fast forward a weeks, and the smash cake turned in to a two tier cake for 40 people and cupcakes as an alternative. Considering I usually bake for only my family (who are easily wowed by my amateur baking skills), I was a little stressed over the situation and the potential of disappointing a room full of people (half of whom I didn''t know real well!) who were expecting bakery quality cake. This cake journey involved a test cake that completely altered the design of the cake, multiple days of baking, a quest to find a better frosting, learning how to support and stack a second layer, getting creative on how to transport said cake, and staying up until 2 am to complete everything because I threw my baking schedule off by making and testing out multiple frosting recipes on the night I was supposed to start frosting everything. Phew! But, in the end, it all worked out. The cake was delicious (thank you Betty Crocker! My next quest is to find a decent cake recipe made from scratch), the frosting was amazing (no, I didn''t find 'the one'"" I''m looking for, but I did manage to find a new recipe I like quite a bit), and it made it safely to its destination in an upside down rubbermaid tote. Now, on to the next baking challenge...""",,,,NewHobby,HobbyEvents,"family meetup, but post is focused on hobby",

I think before) we squeezed in a quick camping trip to Fort Custer.  We decided to do the porch ourselves so we put a few weeks of sweat equity in to framing that out. We spent a few weekends yard-sale-ing (always a summer highlight!!) We decided we needed an above ground pool so we all agreed to forego birthday and Christmas gifts and treat ourselves to having that put in, but then found out our electric lines were in the way so we cancelled the pool; then realized we could move it over a few feet and still squeeze it in so we did that. Then on the install day the crew found an underground bee hive and stopped working because the only person who could drive the bobcat was dealthy allergic, then their truck stalled in our driveway, and then we didn't hear from them for a few days...but it eventually got put in, destroying our backyard and back deck in the process; (which is still a mess, but that's another project). We tried to go camping again but discovered frame issues with our truck (which we bought 6 months ago) that wasn't worth the money to fix. We bought another used truck and sold our other. We finished the porch by putting vinyl decking and railing on. Along the way we tried to turn our inside-turned-outside-because-he-kept-peeing-in-my-basement cat back in to an second-chance-at-living-inside-cat. That lasted about three weeks and he became an inside-turned-outside-turned-inside-turned-outside-again cat - he seems happier, my basement seems happier too. We helped a friend split and haul wood from his friend's recently cut down tree and then found more free wood in Elkhart that required two round trips - our front side yard is filled with wood that needs splitting or stacking still. We rounded this exhausting summer out with a nice long weekend up at Yankee Springs Recreation Area where we swam, boated, fished, swam some more, and enjoyed living around the campfire. It was a fast summer, an exhausting summer, but it was a great summer. How many more days till next summer!?!? with Benjamin Schrader",InstallmentPurchase,,,RemodeledHome,RemodelEvents,,

Tony Bontrager took this picture of me when I took over the Junior Deacon''s spot at then Tyrian Lodge #718 with George Burkley''s prodding.  This was my first year as a Freemason and it was my first officer position in lodge.. Since then, I''ve gone through all of the officer chairs (one per year), helped oversee the move to Goshen, watched as we merged and became Tyrian Lodge #12, finished my Worshipful Master''s year in 2013 and with the help of everyone at the lodge was awarded the Grandmaster''s Award with High Distinction, one of only a handful of lodges that year.  And I''ve made many life long friends through this great organization.. After being Worshipful Master, I was the Venerable Master of the Knights of St. Andrew for the South Bend Valley of Scottish Rite in 2014.. The current chapter in my Masonic life is seeing me work my way through the 8 years of officer chairs in the South Bend Scottish Rite''s Consistory, where I am currently the 1st Lt. Command and a year and a half away from the big seat as Command in Chief right behind Don Laudeman.. Thanks to:.

I was expecting something technical or useful for my training, but what I got was so much more. They talked about why they fight, why they train, and how it affects them. They don''t fight for glory or ego, they fight to survive. Something most of us don''t think about. The biggest eye opener for me though, was that they really drove home the point about how fighting brings people from all different cultures/religions/backgrounds and while you are training you see none of that. When you train, you only see a person, you have no fear or hate, you and your training partner are only there to make each other better. You grow together or you don''t grow at all. . I''ve seen these things even in my gym here in the states. We all have different political views, we are different races and sexes. But we all train together to push each other to be a better version of ourselves.. My favorite times are specifically after a brutal night of chokes or sparring, when you look at each other in the eye, and even though you literally just beat the shit out of each other for an hour, you smile, laugh, fist bump, and get right back to being friends. Better friends than you were before, because fighting brings people closer together.",,,,,,,

When confronted by God after his son, Adam automatically blamed Eve for his sin. God personally told Adam not to write the fruit from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil and Adam disobeyed God‚Äôs directive. Instead of owning his sin he blamed Eve for giving him the fruit. . Fast forward to present day, men catcall women, sexually harass women, sexually assault women, rape women, then turn around and blame the woman for their misbehavior (ie, she was dressed provocatively, she should‚Äôve been more aware). Even worse, men shame the woman for standing up for herself and saying, ‚Äúyou wronged me and your owe me an apology.‚Äù Men still refuse to own their sin, take responsibility, and bear the consequences.. What‚Äôs even more concerning is there appears to be an unwritten rule amongst men where they don‚Äôt hold each other accountable and share in blaming the women. . I for one refuse to accept this as ‚Äúnormal‚Äù or ‚Äújust the way it is.‚Äù I will make my voice heard at the ballot box and I will financially support female candidates that are committed to making our voices heard in the halls of power. I encourage all the women with dreams of holding political office to pursue your dream. Our daughters need to know that they do matter and that they are not supposed to be sexually abused for any reason. Ladies let‚Äôs change the narrative and own our power and our voice.",,,,,,,
