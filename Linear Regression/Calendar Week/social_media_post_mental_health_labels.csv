519,13206448200882729449,"We had an exhausting summer - it started with our camper Dolly getting some repairs and a glamping makeover (she still needs her curtains updated, but there's only so much time in a day...), we became beekeepers, we spent weeks getting quotes to either add a room on our house or get a new roof, siding, and front porch extension; we recovered from a heart attack after getting above mentioned quotes; At some point (before or after? I think before) we squeezed in a quick camping trip to Fort Custer.  We decided to do the porch ourselves so we put a few weeks of sweat equity in to framing that out. We spent a few weekends yard-sale-ing (always a summer highlight!!) We decided we needed an above ground pool so we all agreed to forego birthday and Christmas gifts and treat ourselves to having that put in, but then found out our electric lines were in the way so we cancelled the pool; then realized we could move it over a few feet and still squeeze it in so we did that. Then on the install day the crew found an underground bee hive and stopped working because the only person who could drive the bobcat was dealthy allergic, then their truck stalled in our driveway, and then we didn't hear from them for a few days...but it eventually got put in, destroying our backyard and back deck in the process; (which is still a mess, but that's another project). We tried to go camping again but discovered frame issues with our truck (which we bought 6 months ago) that wasn't worth the money to fix. We bought another used truck and sold our other. We finished the porch by putting vinyl decking and railing on. Along the way we tried to turn our inside-turned-outside-because-he-kept-peeing-in-my-basement cat back in to an second-chance-at-living-inside-cat. That lasted about three weeks and he became an inside-turned-outside-turned-inside-turned-outside-again cat - he seems happier, my basement seems happier too. We helped a friend split and haul wood from his friend's recently cut down tree and then found more free wood in Elkhart that required two round trips - our front side yard is filled with wood that needs splitting or stacking still. We rounded this exhausting summer out with a nice long weekend up at Yankee Springs Recreation Area where we swam, boated, fished, swam some more, and enjoyed living around the campfire.

Considering I usually bake for only my family (who are easily wowed by my amateur baking skills), I was a little stressed over the situation and the potential of disappointing a room full of people (half of whom I didn''t know real well!) who were expecting bakery quality cake. This cake journey involved a test cake that completely altered the design of the cake, multiple days of baking, a quest to find a better frosting, learning how to support and stack a second layer, getting creative on how to transport said cake, and staying up until 2 am to complete everything because I threw my baking schedule off by making and testing out multiple frosting recipes on the night I was supposed to start frosting everything. Phew! But, in the end, it all worked out. The cake was delicious (thank you Betty Crocker! My next quest is to find a decent cake recipe made from scratch), the frosting was amazing (no, I didn''t find 'the one'"" I''m looking for, but I did manage to find a new recipe I like quite a bit), and it made it safely to its destination in an upside down rubbermaid tote.
