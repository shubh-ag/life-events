She settled in remarkably well with Wobbles and Katie, has learned to love lazing on a couch, and is an absolute doll. Many thanks to Greyt Angels Greyhound Adoption for rescuing her and taking such great care of her.

Although we only had the privilege of being your humans for the last three months, you brought a lot of joy and amusement to our lives. You always handled things on your terms, and we appreciated your strong, independent nature. You quickly settled into our pack, but you weren''t shy about letting the other dogs know if they were acting like fools.. We got a lot of laughs when you would deliberately take your treats and plop in front of the other dogs to savor them. If something (or someone) was in your way, you didn''t hesitate to pound on through to your destination. Until last week, we would get tired before you would when playing ball. Although your hearing and vision weren''t at full strength, that didn''t keep you from diving in the boxwood bushes to investigate rabbits and other suspicious interlopers. . We send many thanks to Kalamazoo Animal Rescue, Pita''s foster mom, Rebecca, and Rebecca''s family for taking such great care of Pita while under your care. Although we will always miss her, we are thankful that we got to be a part of her journey.. Rest easy, Pita.

She said she didn’t want to put up with it during exams so she was going to ask to be moved. The teacher moved her thankfully but then told her she had a gentle heart and she put her there because she knew Hannah wouldn’t punch him in the nose. 😤😤😤. No. No. No. Don’t put the kid next to a girl who can tolerate his abhorrent behavior! Put him next to all boys and let him get punched or how about put him next to the teacher?

Well, every time I use the nasal rinse, my sinuses give birth to jellyfish in a disturbing range of colors. Vibrant!. Why yes, I’m on prescription painkillers.

She isn't doing very well at this point. Unable to keep her blood pressure steady. Cancer won this battle and her body is giving up. Doctor's say she won't make it through the day. We are making sure she is very comfortable and in no more pain. Lots of tears but happy she is able to go home with her parents soon. God will be getting another angel. We love you so much Teresa Stark. You have put up one hell of a fight and we are so proud of you.

Sharing some of my pics for my old and new riding friends.. Shannon Johnston thanks for being my Saturday ride wingman, for being a great workout partner, and for signing up with me! I wouldn’t drag myself out of bed so early for the workouts if it weren’t for you. . Amy Nicholson thanks for being my Sunday ride wingman! Misery loves company, and I had a blast laughing with you about our inability to do anything with our legs after 70 cumulative miles.. Kellie Swanson and Jacob Gies it was great meeting you guys, and I hope we get to do more lunchtime rides before it gets too cold!. Brian C. Dolan my favorite part was riding with you at De Soto, seeing the peloton rush by, and turning to you and saying “I’m gonna do it!!” and going balls out for a few miles at around a 22mph pace with the big boys! Great fun riding on Saturday and taking pics along the way.. Kelly Maguire Simeon for letting me play all day Saturday and Sunday while you keep the kid shuttling going and the fort intact. 😘 . And to my family and friends who donated to my cause (you know who you are), your generosity warms my heart, THANK YOU!!!. #bikems				IncreasedSocialActivity				IncreasedSocialActivity	1	IncreasedSocialActivity	Personal	Anticipated	1.0	2.0		0.38511118272639383	392	1.0	1	2018-09-24 00:54:22	697.9622453703704	IncreasedSocialActivity	Anticipated	0.0	476	0	1	Local	SportsEvent	Trained for long bike event	1	2018-07-01	0	2018-09-23	0	9789725f4b8c8f1ee96e92c5f716f9ab	G	Moderately high  confidence	Trained for long bike event	09/23/2018	Ended	personal	1.0	Temporary	1	0	Moderate significance	12827701705279351646	Very Positive	No effect	0	2018-07-01	783.0	SportsEvent

While she and her family knew Emmett would be going through more extensive surgeries throughout his life since he was born with a heart condition, His next surgery may be sooner than expected which shocks us all. I'm no doctor or mother so I have no idea what all is involved and I have no idea of the wretched uncertainty my best friend and her husband may be feeling at this time but I do know that her children are the closest things I've ever had to children and my heart is hurting for little Emmie and his family today. He's been through hell and back already and he's only 2.75 years old so I have no doubt he'll get through it, i just wish i could take away all the stress and pain he may endure. All the prayers and love and well wishes are appreciated at this time for Abigail Flinn and her family.

This morning, Cindy and I got up and cleaned out my 2003 Malibu to take it to a local dealership because I wanted a new car.. As we got close, we were sitting at a stop-light.  Suddenly WHAM!!! I was rear-ended.. Sigh......figures..going to trade in the ride and I get hit.  Cindy jumps out before I did and she''s already around to my side telling me I have no damage.  Guy is back there, I get out and we look - neither of us has any damage.  Really wasn''t anyone''s fault.  Roads were icy and he said he couldn''t get the car to stop despite the fact that he tried way back to stop - I get it - been there and got lucky that I didn''t bump anyone.. I look at the guy and he''s wearing a jacket of the dealership we were going to!  I ask if he works there (his name is also on the jacket so I''m guessing yes).  He does!  . I laughed and said we were just on our way there.. What kind of car are we going to look at?  I said either a Hyundai or Subaru - that''s where he works!!  So I told him we were going to get a Starbucks and we''d be over - I even offered to buy him a coffee (which he declined) - then we informed him he was going to be our salesman.. By the time we got there, everyone in the dealership was talking about how he rear-ended my car and ended up getting a customer.. Yeah I got a car - nice deal and everyone there was exceptionally nice.. *We''re both a little sore from the jolt but nothing bad.

I think before) we squeezed in a quick camping trip to Fort Custer.  We decided to do the porch ourselves so we put a few weeks of sweat equity in to framing that out. We spent a few weekends yard-sale-ing (always a summer highlight!!) We decided we needed an above ground pool so we all agreed to forego birthday and Christmas gifts and treat ourselves to having that put in, but then found out our electric lines were in the way so we cancelled the pool; then realized we could move it over a few feet and still squeeze it in so we did that. Then on the install day the crew found an underground bee hive and stopped working because the only person who could drive the bobcat was dealthy allergic, then their truck stalled in our driveway, and then we didn't hear from them for a few days...but it eventually got put in, destroying our backyard and back deck in the process; (which is still a mess, but that's another project). We tried to go camping again but discovered frame issues with our truck (which we bought 6 months ago) that wasn't worth the money to fix. We bought another used truck and sold our other. We finished the porch by putting vinyl decking and railing on. Along the way we tried to turn our inside-turned-outside-because-he-kept-peeing-in-my-basement cat back in to an second-chance-at-living-inside-cat. That lasted about three weeks and he became an inside-turned-outside-turned-inside-turned-outside-again cat - he seems happier, my basement seems happier too. We helped a friend split and haul wood from his friend's recently cut down tree and then found more free wood in Elkhart that required two round trips - our front side yard is filled with wood that needs splitting or stacking still. We rounded this exhausting summer out with a nice long weekend up at Yankee Springs Recreation Area where we swam, boated, fished, swam some more, and enjoyed living around the campfire. It was a fast summer, an exhausting summer, but it was a great summer. How many more days till next summer!?!? with Benjamin Schrader	InstallmentPurchase			RemodeledHome	RemodelEvents			RemodeledHome	0	RemodeledHome	Personal	Anticipated	2.0	2.0		0.7976152110860457	459	1.0	1	2018-08-16 01:23:40	736.9418981481482	RemodeledHome	Anticipated	0.0	603	0	2	Personal	Vacation	Vacation	2	2018-08-10	0	2018-08-14	0	97e5571972d37834f879388f5aead552	NDL2	Highest confidence	Vacation	08/14/2018	Ended	personal	0.0	Temporary	1	0	Moderate significance	13206448200882729449	Very Positive	Small negative effect	0	2018-08-10	743.0	Vacation

She is creative, her imagination as well as the way she processes things really astonishes me. I often wonder ''how did your head get from here to there?''. She is a fighter, my goodness is she a fighter!! Well, stubborn could be a word to describe her also ( and can be applied to getting her own way) but she stands up for what she believes, more than anyone I know, and if she ever grows out of being a people pleaser like her parents, watch out, she will be a force to be reckoned with! She can''t stand injustice and wants to do something about it.. She is amazingly honest and authentic! Take her or leave her, this is who she is! She is an amazing woman and has grown into an astounding person, and I am so proud of her.
