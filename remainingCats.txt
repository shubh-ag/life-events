My best friend Jim (he had been helping me remodel my home since 2006) basically dropped out of my life when he found out that I was having Lowes do my kitchen.  I paid my friend (against his wishes but he needed the cash) to work on my home - but I was tired of it taking forever to get done so I went to Lowes to get the kitchen finished in a matter of months rather than years.  He didn't say it hurt his feelings, but he suddenly stopped really being "present"?  I had to go out of my way to have contact.  His birthday is Jan 14, we arranged to go out to eat on 2/14/19 because his SO was going to a concert in Indy.  I spoke to him about the house and my job situation and he got really animated about how I needed to quit my job and move; along with getting really loud.  The next (and last outside of work - he works in a dept that I was in before OIT) I had with him was 3/31/19 - he came over to help me lift Kye (my 90# dog) into the van so I could take him to the Emergency Vet to have him put to sleep.
