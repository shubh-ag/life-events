I think before) we squeezed in a quick camping trip to Fort Custer.  We decided to do the porch ourselves so we put a few weeks of sweat equity in to framing that out. We spent a few weekends yard-sale-ing (always a summer highlight!!) We decided we needed an above ground pool so we all agreed to forego birthday and Christmas gifts and treat ourselves to having that put in, but then found out our electric lines were in the way so we cancelled the pool; then realized we could move it over a few feet and still squeeze it in so we did that. Then on the install day the crew found an underground bee hive and stopped working because the only person who could drive the bobcat was dealthy allergic, then their truck stalled in our driveway, and then we didn't hear from them for a few days...but it eventually got put in, destroying our backyard and back deck in the process; (which is still a mess, but that's another project). We tried to go camping again but discovered frame issues with our truck (which we bought 6 months ago) that wasn't worth the money to fix. We bought another used truck and sold our other. We finished the porch by putting vinyl decking and railing on. Along the way we tried to turn our inside-turned-outside-because-he-kept-peeing-in-my-basement cat back in to an second-chance-at-living-inside-cat. That lasted about three weeks and he became an inside-turned-outside-turned-inside-turned-outside-again cat - he seems happier, my basement seems happier too. We helped a friend split and haul wood from his friend's recently cut down tree and then found more free wood in Elkhart that required two round trips - our front side yard is filled with wood that needs splitting or stacking still. We rounded this exhausting summer out with a nice long weekend up at Yankee Springs Recreation Area where we swam, boated, fished, swam some more, and enjoyed living around the campfire.

Here I am on the left at 134lbs on July 25th 2018 pre coach/prep and on the right at 124lb this morning after Chest and Core at the gym!. There''s no doubt this ish is HARD. . The diet restrictions, not getting to go out and have a beer or two, sticking to a grind and waking up before the sun to pump that iron 6 days a week and only 1 single tbsp of peanut butter per week, people!! üòÇ. While it''s hard and frustrating some days, the reward is glorious. I feel good, I have to put my mind to work, talk to myself when I have cravings and challenge my body by upping that weight all the time! I gave myself the ultimate challenge and I definitely wouldnt change it.. This transformation photo was not even on purpose, I was organizing my photos into albums and found that old sports bra pic from 4 months ago! Remembered I took a picture in the mirror practicing my arm gesture for front pose and put them together and I couldn''t believe my eyes! üòç. A piece of advice- Always be a little kinder than necessary, challenge yourself, follow your heart every single time and step out of your comfort zone every once in a while. üåçüèãÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüí™üèªüíüüî•.
